# Tableau Visualization Challenges 
by **Albert Lleida**

Welcome to my Tableau Visualization Challenges repository! Here, as a Junior Data Analyst, I participate in the #WorkoutWednesday challenges, practicing and enhancing my visualization skills by reproducing various data-driven visualizations using Tableau.

## About Workout Wednesday

Workout Wednesday is a weekly challenge designed to kick-start personal development in Tableau and PowerBI. Each Wednesday, a new challenge is released, and participants are asked to replicate the challenge as closely as possible.

## Folder Structure

- WOW[year]_W[week]

Each folder labeled WOW[year]_W[week] represents a specific challenge I've attempted. Inside each folder, you'll find:

- `README.md` including information about the challenge, links to the original task and to my Tableau solution, and then my visualization.
