# Tableau Visualization Challenges 
by **Albert Lleida**

Welcome to my Tableau Visualization Challenges repository! Here, as a Junior Data Analyst, I participate in the #WorkoutWednesday challenges, practicing and enhancing my visualization skills by reproducing various data-driven visualizations using Tableau.

## About Workout Wednesday

Workout Wednesday is a weekly challenge designed to kick-start personal development in Tableau and PowerBI. Each Wednesday, a new challenge is released, and participants are asked to replicate the challenge as closely as possible.

When you've completed a challenge, you can leave a comment with a link to your visualization, share it on Tableau Public, or post it on Twitter for others to enjoy.

## Folder Structure

- WOW[year]_W[week]

Each folder labeled WOW[year]_W[week] represents a specific challenge I've attempted. Inside each folder, you'll find:

- `README.md` containing details about the challenge, a link to the original challenge, a link to my Tableau visualization solution, and an image of my visualization.

Feel free to explore each challenge folder to see my solutions and approach for different Workout Wednesday challenges.

Enjoy exploring the visualizations and solutions! ðŸ“Šâœ¨
