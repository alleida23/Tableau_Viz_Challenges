### Overview

This visualization project was inspired by a Workout Wednesday challenge ("Hexbin Map of Rat Sightings in NYC" - [WOW2022 | Week 16](https://workout-wednesday.com/2022w16tab/)) by Sean Miller, introducing me to techniques for using **Hexbin maps**. It involved working with latitude and longitude data, utilizing the HEXBINX and HEXBINY inbuilt Tableau functions, parameter management for HexBin maps like 'Ratio', and integrating shapes and color palettes in Tableau. 

The visual power of Hexbin maps immediately captivated me, and I recognized their potential to provide a fresh perspective on a previous earthquake-related project I'd been working on several months prior. My interest in earthquakes stems from my time in Chile, where I was welcomed by an 8.4 magnitude earthquake in the Coquimbo Region in 2015. My first ever experienced... quite a memorable debut!

### Project Background - Chile's Seismic Insights

The **[Chile's Seismic Insights (2010-2023)](https://github.com/alleida23/Chile_Recent_Earthquakes/)** project aimed to analyze seismic events in Chile. It leveraged web scraping, Python data analysis, and Tableau visualization to explore seismic activity trends, magnitudes, depths, and occurrences based on a dataset from 2010 to the present.

### Visualization Challenge - Applying New Techniques

In response to WOW22 W16 map challenge, I improved previous visualizations using new skills, particularly focusing on Hexbin maps. The new Tableau visualization of recent earthquakes in Chile incorporates HexBin Heat Maps, Scatter plots, Bar charts, and interactive features, providing deeper insights into seismic activity in Chile.

The visualization project aims to capture the frequency and distribution of earthquakes, focusing on improving visualization to better represent the seismic activity observed in Chile.

### Final Thoughts

Combining my experiences and new Tableau skills allowed me to revisit the earthquake project with greater insight and visual depth. The Hexbin map challenge significantly contributed to the enhanced representation of seismic data
