# Workout Wednesday Challenge: UpSet Plot in Tableau
**By Albert Lleida, November 2023**

## Challenge Description

I'm a Junior Data Analyst enhancing my visualization skills in Tableau. This is my first time engaging with Workout Wednesdays by Tableau, and this project is the result.

### Challenge Details

- **Challenge:** Built an UpSet plot to visualize combinations of customers purchasing from different sub-categories within Furniture.
- **Level:** Advanced - First attempt at such a complex visualization as a Junior Data Analyst.
- **Progress:** Managed to bring it down to just one calculated field for enhanced efficiency.

#### Key Features

- **Dataset Source:** 20222 Superstore Dataset on Data.World.
- **Dashboard Size:** 1200 x 800 px.
- **Custom Calculations:** 1.
- **Features:** Interactive view enabling users to explore sales data based on different customer cohorts.

This visualization presents the detailed UpSet plot created for the Workout Wednesday challenge. Explore customer purchasing patterns within Furniture sub-categories interactively.

### Development Progress

To solve the main challenges of this project, the information available at [The Information Lab](https://www.theinformationlab.co.uk/2020/01/19/creating-upset-plots-in-tableau/) was tremendously helpful. I've learned about the `FIXED` function in Tableau, which proved vital in solving the cohort customers' challenge.

The `FIXED` function in Tableau allows for calculating an expression using the specified dimensions, irrespective of the other fields in the view. In this challenge, the `FIXED` function enabled the creation of the 'Fixed_CustomerID' calculated field, aggregating customers' sub-category purchases.

Additionally, the article guided me in understanding how to construct the UpSet plot using an index for sorting and setting up the visualization. Employing a CASE statement as an index twice (as dimension and circle), along with a double axis, was pivotal to merge both plots. Overcoming the continuous line challenge was resolved by integrating the 'line dimension' into the mark's path, providing a solution for the consistent line across column dots.

This learning experience allowed me to better grasp Tableau's capabilities and significantly enhanced my visualization techniques.


### Looking Forward

I'm open to feedback and excited to keep honing my Tableau skills. Always learning and improving! ðŸš€ðŸ“ˆ
